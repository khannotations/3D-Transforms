# 3D-Transforms

This is a fun page that explores creating 3D shapes (prisms and cards) with using CSS 3 only. The only Javascript used is a smidge of AngularJS for the first dropdown. Source available on Github (uses SCSS).  

Inspired by the work at http://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/. All work MIT licensed.
